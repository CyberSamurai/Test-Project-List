"""
This is the mega project list from:
http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/

I will be working through as many as I can and pushing them to my GitHub.

This will give me practice with using Git and programming (with Python).

I will put a doctring at the beginning of each mini project describing the 
project rules and intentions as well as the name of the project.
